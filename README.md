# NoSQL Challenge: Social Network API

## Splufik-social-network
Splufik-social-network API allows users to perform CRUD operations on social networking data models using a NoSQL database. The data models include friends, users, thoughts, and reaction data models, and they can be retrieved by ID or all of them. This API is built using Node.js and Mongoose.
